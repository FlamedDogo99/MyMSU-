# MyMSU-

Missing the 1990's aesthetic of Montana State University's MyInfo website?
MyMSU- brings back that nostalgic look of MyMSU, removing unnecessary animations, scrolling and clutter.

### Installation

MyMSU- is currently a userscript and a browser extension for Chrome, Firefox, and Edge.

As MyMSU- is still awaiting verification as a browser extension, the easiest way to use it
is through a userscript application. The userscript can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FlamedDogo99/MyMSU-/refs/heads/main/userscript/myinfominus.user.js).
